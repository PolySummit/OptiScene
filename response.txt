The primary focus is on arranging the large sectional sofa in a way that maximizes floor space and creates an open feel. The sofa will be placed along the longer wall, with its back slightly turned towards the center of the room to create a more dynamic layout.

The coffee table will be positioned directly in front of the sofa, slightly off-center to allow for natural traffic flow. This placement also ensures that no one has to walk over the coffee table.

The large TV stand will be placed parallel to the sofa along another wall, creating a symmetrical and balanced appearance. It is positioned near the edge of the room to maximize space.

The console table will be placed at the opposite end of the room, against the shorter wall, to break up the long wall of the TV stand and add visual interest.

Two floor lamps are placed at the ends of the sofa to provide ambient lighting while also serving as decorative accents.

Finally, the medium-sized wooden side cabinet is positioned at the far end of the longer wall, close to the corner, to further define the room's layout and provide additional storage.

This layout ensures clear traffic flow and maintains an open feel, with key furniture pieces aligned along the edges of the room.
